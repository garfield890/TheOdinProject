    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tacos are a versatile and beloved dish originating from Mexico, consisting of a soft or crispy tortilla filled with a variety of ingredients. 
        The base often includes seasoned meats like beef, chicken, pork, or fish, but vegetarian options with beans, grilled vegetables, or plant-based proteins are equally popular. 
        Toppings such as fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, cheese, and creamy sauces like sour cream or guacamole add vibrant flavors and textures. A squeeze of lime and a splash of salsa—ranging from mild to spicy—complete the perfect bite. 
        Tacos can be enjoyed as a quick street food snack or a hearty meal, showcasing the rich flavors and traditions of Mexican cuisine.</p>
