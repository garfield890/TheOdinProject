    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish layered with rich flavors and textures that make it a comforting favorite. 
        It starts with wide, flat pasta sheets that are layered with hearty meat sauce or marinara, creamy ricotta cheese, and a blend of melted mozzarella and parmesan. 
        Each layer is carefully assembled, creating a stack of alternating sauces, cheeses, and pasta that meld together during baking. 
        The dish is often seasoned with aromatic herbs like basil, oregano, and garlic, adding depth to every bite. 
        Once baked, the lasagna develops a golden, bubbly crust on top, with soft, savory layers beneath that offer a perfect balance of flavors and a satisfying heartiness.</p>
