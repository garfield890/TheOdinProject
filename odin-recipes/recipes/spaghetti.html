    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish layered with rich flavors and textures that make it a comforting favorite. 
        It starts with wide, flat pasta sheets that are layered with hearty meat sauce or marinara, creamy ricotta cheese, and a blend of melted mozzarella and parmesan. 
        Each layer is carefully assembled, creating a stack of alternating sauces, cheeses, and pasta that meld together during baking. 
        The dish is often seasoned with aromatic herbs like basil, oregano, and garlic, adding depth to every bite. 
        Once baked, the lasagna develops a golden, bubbly crust on top, with soft, savory layers beneath that offer a perfect balance of flavors and a satisfying heartiness.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna Noodles</li>
        <li>Marinara Sauce</li>
        <li>Ricotta Cheese</li>
        <li>Shredded Mozarella Cheese</li>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Meat: Brown the ground beef or sausage in a skillet, drain the fat, and mix it with the marinara sauce.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Noodles: If using regular lasagna noodles, boil them until al dente. Skip this step for oven-ready noodles.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Layers: In a baking dish, layer marinara sauce, noodles, ricotta cheese, and shredded mozzarella. Repeat until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of mozzarella on top.</li>
        <li>Bake: Cover with foil and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10–15 minutes until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Rest and Serve: Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
