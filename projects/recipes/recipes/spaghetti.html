    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti is a long, thin, cylindrical pasta that is a staple of Italian cuisine and loved worldwide. 
        Made primarily from wheat flour and water, it is versatile and pairs well with a variety of sauces, from classic marinara and rich Bolognese to creamy Alfredo or light olive oil-based dressings. 
        Spaghetti is traditionally cooked al dente, giving it a slightly firm texture that enhances its ability to hold sauces and flavors. 
        Often served with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs, it is a comforting and satisfying dish that can be enjoyed in simple preparations or elevated with gourmet ingredients like seafood, truffles, or high-quality meats. 
        Whether served as part of a casual meal or a fine dining experience, spaghetti remains a timeless favorite.</p>
